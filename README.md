# FA-ViT


------
This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation for FA-ViT. Note that we currently only released the model and pre-trained model since it is easy to evaluate on your customized dataset. Please forgive the irregular variable naming in the code, it is too busy for me to re-organize the source code T.T.

## Requirements
- timm == 0.5.4
- pytorch == 1.8.0

## planning schedule
- [ ] release evaluation code
- [ ] release trained model
- [ ] release training code
